# discord-mass-channel-delete
A simple bot command I made with discord.py so you can erase a majority of channels. It might be useful in case of your server being raided or some malicious staff

Usage: ac!delete_channels [channel name] [exception] -> channel id which will be skipped if it has the same name, None by default
